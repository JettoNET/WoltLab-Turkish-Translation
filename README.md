#WoltLab Turkish Translation

Welcome to my profile! I am a professional translator with a focus on WoltLab forum software. My expertise lies in translating XML files into Turkish without compromising the code structure. By ensuring that the content is meaningful and accurate, I help forum sites provide a seamless and engaging experience for their users.

My goal is to deliver precise translations for key terms such as "Sub-Forum," which I translate as "Alt Forum," enhancing the clarity and usability of the forum for Turkish-speaking users.

If you need professional translation services for your WoltLab forum or have any questions, feel free to reach out. Let's make your forum accessible and user-friendly for the Turkish community together!
